# AI Prompts Repository

Welcome to the `ai-prompts` repository! This is a small collection of personal prompts for chatbots like ChatGPT, meant to help you with specific tasks. For now, there are two prompts available:

## Contents

1. [Pull Request Description Generator](prompts/pull_request_description.md)
2. [JIRA Ticket Description Creator](prompts/jira_ticket_description.md)

## Usage

To use these prompts, open the linked files above, and copy the prompt text. Input the text into a chatbot like ChatGPT and let the AI generate a response. You can then use the generated response as a starting point for your pull request or JIRA ticket descriptions.
